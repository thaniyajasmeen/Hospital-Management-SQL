# Hospital Management System

This project is a SQL-based database management system designed for hospitals to streamline administrative and medical functions. The system organizes essential data related to hospitals, doctors, patients, appointments, and billing, ensuring efficient, accurate, and accessible management.

## 📋 Project Overview

The Hospital Management System database project was created to:
- Simplify complex hospital data handling processes.
- Improve accuracy and efficiency in patient and staff management.
- Ensure easy access to crucial information for effective decision-making.

## 📊 Database Design

The database includes the following main tables:

- **Hospital**: Stores information about hospital branches, heads, and locations.
- **Doctors**: Contains doctor details, including specializations and associated hospitals.
- **Patients**: Manages patient information like name, age, and gender.
- **Appointments**: Tracks appointments with patient, doctor, date, and diagnosis details.
- **Billing**: Records billing details with associated patient and appointment information.

## 🚀 Features

- **Patient Registration**: Records patient information for easy access and updates.
- **Doctor Assignment**: Links doctors to hospitals and manages their specializations.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: Maintains detailed appointment records for patient care.
- **Billing Management**: Generates bills based on patient visits and services provided.

## 📄 SQL Code Overview

### Table Creation

- **Hospital Table**: Defines hospital details with primary key `hosp_name`.
- **Doctors Table**: Stores doctor information linked to the hospital.
- **Patients Table**: Manages patient demographics.
- **Appointments Table**: Contains appointment details and links to patients and doctors.
- **Billing Table**: Tracks patient billing information and links to appointments.

### Sample Data

Sample data is included in the project to demonstrate the functionality of each table and its relationships.

## 🛠 Requirements

- **SQL Database**: Compatible with Oracle Database 21c or other SQL environments.

## 📝 Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Reporting**: Generate reports for patient history, billing summaries, and doctor performance.
- **User Roles**: Add access control based on user roles (e.g., admin, medical staff).
- **Integration with Front-End**: Build a front-end interface for easier data entry and visualization.
